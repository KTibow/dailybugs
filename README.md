# Daily Bugs

Daily Bugs is the personal AI linter: every day, it gives you a list of bugs it thinks you committed.

## No PRs needed

PRs are great when you're working together with skilled contributors and reviewers, and existing review bots add on to them nicely. But sometimes you're working on a personal project where you push straight to main. Daily Bugs analyzes every commit you make.

## Automatic

You should be able to forget about your linter. You shouldn't have to copy/paste your diff or make a PR or open a special panel. You also shouldn't have to think about whether your favorite language is supported or whether your repo is configured or how to convince LLMs of fact.

Daily Bugs does a really good job at this. It just emails you or pings you every day if it sees any bugs.

## Free

We, thanks to [Hack Club's generous free AI](https://ai.hackclub.com/), give you a scan every day for free. To put that in perspective, the closest existing product to Daily Bugs is [Detail](https://detail.dev/), and it asks you for \$15 per scan (of which it runs every 2 weeks).
